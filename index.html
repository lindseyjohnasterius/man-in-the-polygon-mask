      <h2>Please allow me to introduce myself</h2>

      <p>Pardon me, I'm rude as hell. You'll just have to get used to it. I'm a consultant, one of the vultures tasked with tearing apart the digital wreckage of a city once called the City Of Angels. From what I've found that was the single biggest bit of false advertising in the petro-capital days.. </p>

      <p>But, we aren't here to quibble with such unimportant things as "truth" and "falsehood", we're here to find the scraps of <wikipedia-entry value="intellectual property">IP</wikipedia-entry> that are still pertinent, after the city's sudden, quite expected decline </p>

      <p>Keep in mind, what you see isn't real -- it's a simulacrum of a city. Don't get lost in the glitter -- it's all fake.</p>
      <p>There are a contigient of people who would tell you that Los Angeles never existed. In the early 21st century there was a derranged artist named LNSY who insisted Los Angeles never existed at all. I guess we can't say either way, but there certainly is a lot of wreckage </p>
              
      <p>History is for the victors, and we're garbage pickers of the new age, so I guess we're just not going to comment.</p>
