Mark Z. Danielewski set most of his novel House of Leaves in Los Angeles for good reason. Not since the Minoans has such a labyrinth of a city been built. Having dug through the wreckage as much as anyone that there weren't any angels, but every citizen a minotaur.

Describing a city intent on strangling itself, that danced at the end of the world so beautifully and manically turns into a kind of madness of its own. I'm just a contractor, I get docked if I editorialize too much. Somewhere the youtube streamers and the parisitic agents all mingled together into something that resembled a civilization but never quite gelled. It was a society of mutual hauntings and neighborhoods you didn't go to at night for different reasons. 
  
To me it seemed like a place of beautiful dreams turned bad, that moment when a wet dream becomes a nightmare.
