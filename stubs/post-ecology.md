## Environment Calamity

We cannot deny, though many try, that we are entering an age of environmental calamity.


## The Aesthethics of the Natural

I have friends and family who pride themselves on raising their children "organically"-- without exposure to Genetically Modified Organisms, Red Dye number 2 and other environmental toxins.

I am not going to deny preservatives, dyes and other chemical processes can have toxic and odd effects on human beings-- but I am arguing that most of the resistance to Genetically Modified Foods is aesthethic, tied up with class signalling more than a provision for health or morality.

## AntiBiotics resistance in the food supply.

## Humans have always changed nature

Painters, human interferance, The Mushroom at the end of the world, etc
