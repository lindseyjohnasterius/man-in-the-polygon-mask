title: "The Triumph of Virtue and Nobility over Ignorance"

---
Tiepolo's Triumph of Virtue and Nobility over Ignorance is a decorative painting pretending to be an allegory.

Two beautiful women, and looking at their haughty expressions, know it (Virtue and Nobility, I gather) hover above you in the clouds, wrought in Tiepolo's pastel pallette. The mean hot girls at the party oyu don't belong at. Below them, not even worth their recognition, ignorance tumbles from the clouds.

There are the obligatory puti, doing their puti things-- blowing horns, observing the scene, just generally hanging out as puti do.

The painting, in composition, seems to owe a lot to numerous versions of the Fall of Lucifer, homogenized and gussied up for the sophisticated Rococoo set -- instead of the Adversary, we have Ignorance -- of course, ignorance is a person of color, expressing the colonizer instincts of his age.

It is a classic Tiepolo: the perspect, you are on the ground looking up at a pastel wonder land.
