If there is a virus in the paper work, a charismatic mega-algorithm and decision tree, then staging advantageous economic meltdowns could be an effective strategy.

It would work like this:

the algorithm spins off a subsidiary, that then begins to borrow money based on it's (on paper) assets. It could buy other bad debt, it could issue junk bonds. With that cash, it could then leverage key indicator companies in the economic system, and sell low. A sudden sell off of assets, the subsidiary ai company goes bankrupt, but it's job has been done: the other co-AI's can sweep in to take advantage of the disorder.

Can an algorithm be convicted of insider trading? Of Pump and Dumping?

More likely, new behaviors, new criminalities and thus new wealth will be generated across the system -- are we looking for Stasis.
