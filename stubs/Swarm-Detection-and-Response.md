title: "Swarm Detection and Response"

---
According to Byung-Chul Han the dominant organizational structure of the digital age is the swarm. Individuals acting on their own impulses, moving in a direction.

Amplified or drowned out by bots, opportunists, hucksters and sincere activists and politicians, the general messiness of reality.

Assymetrical communication strategies. Faked virality becomes real virality.

Sincere activists are amplified by insincere Russian Bots, support of the bots does not indicate their impulse.

We need new tools to understand the swarm, to analyze and navigate this new terrain.

A new map for new terrains.
