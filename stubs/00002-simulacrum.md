Keep in mind, what you see isn't real -- it's a simulacrum of a city. Don't get lost in the glitter -- it's all fake.

There are a contigient of people who would tell you that Los Angeles never existed. In the early 21st century there was a derranged artist named LNSY who insisted Los Angeles never existed at all. I guess we can't say either way, but there certainly is a lot of wreckage 
        
History is for the victors, and we're garbage pickers of the new age, so I guess we're just not going to comment.
