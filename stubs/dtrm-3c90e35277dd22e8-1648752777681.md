I didn't like Tiepolo for many years. Too flouncy, all in pastel colors, the same perspective (from the ground, you stare up at beautiful angels and cherubs that could be allegory, but on further inspection say nothing). It wasn't until I saw a series of pastels he did of people in the crowds of Madrid-- ugly, the compositions almost clausterphobic, did I understand his command of subtext and emotion.

I also liked that -- Giovanni being out of style these days until the Vapor Wave kids get ahold of him -- his room at the Prado was deliciously quiet. Everyone crowds the Bosch's and the Goyas, but it is quiet by the Tiepolos at the prado.

Tiepolo, being one of those artists who ran a studio closer to what we would call a factory, produced a lot. His looking up paintings sold well and so he did a lot of them. Los Angeles is quite blessed with several good Tiepolos, the best one is at the Norton Simon -- "The Victory of Virtue and Nobility over Ignorance"
