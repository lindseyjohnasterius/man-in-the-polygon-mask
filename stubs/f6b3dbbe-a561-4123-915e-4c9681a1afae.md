### Narrative

I think it is very important that I start with this: I have never even seen a riot, let alone started one. It's hard to grasp what it's like to see your face on one of the vid feeds on the sides of One Wilshire, in the middle of something that didn't happen. I need to tell you what I saw, but I need time to figure out the narrative-- it's just too big right now.

I still walk free, my name being slandered and counter slandered by the bots, being deleted by malware and automated DMCA bots, the constant roar of that digital ocean. It's a shit storm the likes the world has ever seen. The company, that graph link between me and it, kicks up the AI bots, and the Sabatoge drones, waging an information war with physical side effects, the repair drones and counter-drone drones dancing like a swarm above real life, also. They drop like dead sparrows, a great extinction in technological supremecy.

I guess I'm trying to get to you so you can understand this outside of the context collapse: there is a  <<glitches removed because they were breaking my software>>
