          <h2>Please allow me to introduce myself</h2><p>Pardon me, I'm rude as hell. You'll just have to get used to it. I'm a consultant, one of the vultures tasked with tearing apart the digital wreckage of a city once called the City Of Angels. From what I've found that was the single biggest bit of false advertising in the petro-capital days.. </p><p>But, we aren't here to quibble with such unimportant things as "truth" and "falsehood", we're here to find the scraps of IP that are still pertinent, after the city's sudden, quite expected decline=.</p>

        <article class="content">
          <p>Keep in mind, what you see isn't real -- it's a simulacrum of a city. Don't get lost in the glitter -- it's all fake.</p><p>There are a contigient of people who would tell you that Los Angeles never existed. In the early 21st century there was a derranged artist named LNSY who insisted Los Angeles never existed at all. I guess we can't say either way, but there certainly is a lot of wreckage </p><p>History is for the victors, and we're garbage pickers of the new age, so I guess we're just not going to comment.</p>

          <p>Mark Z. Danielewski set most of his novel House of Leaves in Los Angeles for good reason. Not since the Minoans has such a labyrinth of a city been built. Having dug through the wreckage as much as anyone that there weren't any angels, but every citizen a minotaur.</p><p>Describing a city intent on strangling itself, that danced at the end of the world so beautifully and manically turns into a kind of madness of its own. I'm just a contractor, I get docked if I editorialize too much. Somewhere the youtube streamers and the parisitic agents all mingled together into something that resembled a civilization but never quite gelled. It was a society of mutual hauntings and neighborhoods you didn't go to at night for different reasons. </p><p>To me it seemed like a place of beautiful dreams turned bad, that moment when a wet dream becomes a nightmare.</p>
